One of the projects that was complete whilst I was there was a bespoke Wordpress theme for an external client.</p><p>From the off this was a challenge, never having looked at any of the backend or php code required to get Wordpress to work. This required lots of documentation research in order to be able to display the correct items etc.</p><p>The project was managed through <a href="http://asana.com" target="_blank">Asana</a>, which is a project management tool. The job was broken down, much like a Kanban board. Each team member had an asigned role and at the end of the day all work was commited to the products git repo.</p><p>After a while browsing, I did come across a couple of sites offering a styling service for their users. A stylist however is involved and requires additional information to be passed through than it seems is possible on the website alone. Inspirationally though, the initial concept is worth exploring.</p><aside class="gallery"><div class="art"><img src="images/fwp-01.png" alt="screen grab of abc asbestos site"></div><div class="art"><img src="images/fwp-02.png" alt="screen grab of abc asbestos site"></div></aside><p>As well as the code, plugins were required to complete required functionality. The clients had requested a shortlist containing free and paid for plugins. Afterwards it was standard dashboard configuration and writing of content and ensuring SEO was observed as much as possible.</p></div></div></article><footer><p>&copy; Mark Williams 2017, all rights reserved</p><p>View original repo <a href="https://bitbucket.org/williamsmark81/willows/" target="_blank" title="github repo opens in new window">here</a></p></footer></body></html>
