No reason why it was chinese, Well ok, it was a smaller task asigned from the university. Still it was an interesting topic and the fact that the site is Chinese holds some interesting results later on.</p><p>The first thought I followed was where is the actual host server compared to the actual users. Following the geographical IP of the server it turns out the main domain is located in Liverpool or Cheshire (It depends on which lookup service you want to use). At the same time I ran some network tests using Google Chromes dev tools. Thats a lot of files in that website!</p><p>Good practice of using alternate domains to host various files in order to bypass the HTTP request limit. More domains, means more simultanious files downloaded. Only problem here though, was when testing at home in the UK, I was getting the same Content Delivery Networks for each file when testing in other parts of the world. When running a geographical lookup on the domains, they're located in Atlanta, Georgia in the USA. Just to give you an idea...</p><aside class="gallery"><div class="art map"><img src="images/gbrchn.png" alt="Map of UK to China"></div><div class="art map"><img src="images/usachn.png" alt="Map of USA to China"></div></aside><p>Ok, so maybe The Hut Group could use CDN's that keep copies of the site in various locations around the globe in order to speed up the delivery or at the very least, reduce the initial ping and travel times of the data.</p><p>The content itself then, as mentioned earlier the waterfall model from the network tab in Chrome highlighted a lot of files. It turns out that around half of those files are JavaScript! Again good practice is mostly observed through the use of minified files in order to reduce the file size as much as possible. A few exceptions did appear but these were 3rd party scripts. It may be worth while either getting the files and minifying it themselves or checking out if there is already a minified version of the file out there.</p><p>Images, For the most part the images are of an acceptable size. Depending on which tool you use I got the additional optimisation anywhere from around 170KiB to 550KiB (You know I had to Google what a KiB was too, it's ok). It doesn't sound like much but if your talking mobile devices, then half a MB is a reasonable amount of data to try and reduce. It could be easier though and even more effective with the use of "srcset" in the img tag. The srcset is a little bit like an array or a list of breakpoints with the relevant associated picture to display.</p><p>&lt;img src="legacy.jpg" srcset="small.jpg 320w, medium.jpg 720w, large 1080w" alt="Alt information"&gt;</p><p>It should be that easy</p></div></div></article><footer><p>&copy; Mark Williams 2017, all rights reserved</p><p>View original repo <a href="https://bitbucket.org/williamsmark81/willows/" target="_blank" title="github repo opens in new window">here</a></p></footer></body></html>
